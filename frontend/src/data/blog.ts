## Planning Your Home Cleanout

A successful home cleanout starts with a solid plan. Whether you are tackling a single room or an entire house, having a strategy saves time, money, and stress. Jacksonville homeowners frequently undertake cleanout projects for various reasons: downsizing to a smaller home, preparing a property for sale, clearing out an estate, or simply reclaiming space from years of accumulated belongings.

### Step 1: Assess the Scope

Before ordering a dumpster or gathering supplies, walk through every room and assess what needs to go. Make notes about:

- **Large furniture pieces** that need removal
- **Appliances** that are outdated or broken
- **Boxes of stored items** in closets, attics, and garages
- **Yard debris** and outdoor items

This assessment helps you estimate the right dumpster size and plan your timeline.

### Step 2: Sort and Categorize

Create four categories for everything in your home:

1. **Keep**: Items you use regularly or have significant value
2. **Donate**: Gently used items that others can benefit from
3. **Sell**: Valuable items worth the effort of selling
4. **Dispose**: Broken, worn out, or unusable items

Jacksonville has numerous donation centers including Goodwill, Salvation Army, and local charities that accept furniture, clothing, and household goods in good condition.

### Step 3: Choose the Right Dumpster Size

For most whole-home cleanouts in Jacksonville, we recommend:

- **10-yard dumpster**: Single room or small apartment cleanout
- **15-yard dumpster**: Multiple rooms or small house cleanout
- **20-yard dumpster**: Whole house cleanout or large estate cleanout

Our team at 904 Dumpster can help you determine the right size based on your specific situation.

## Tips for an Efficient Cleanout

### Start with the Easiest Areas

Build momentum by tackling easier spaces first. The garage or a spare bedroom often provides a satisfying start without the emotional attachment of more personal spaces.

### Use the One-Year Rule

If you have not used an item in the past year and it does not hold significant sentimental value, it is likely time to let it go.

### Take Photos of Sentimental Items

For items with sentimental value that you do not have space to keep, take photos before disposing of them. This preserves the memory without the physical clutter.

### Do Not Forget Hidden Spaces

Attics, crawl spaces, under beds, and the backs of closets often harbor forgotten items. Make sure to check these areas during your cleanout.

## Jacksonville-Specific Considerations

### Donation Drop-Off Locations

- **Goodwill**: Multiple locations throughout Jacksonville
- **Salvation Army**: Free pickup available for large items
- **Habitat for Humanity ReStore**: Accepts building materials and home goods
- **Local churches**: Many accept clothing and household items

### What Cannot Go in the Dumpster

Some items require special disposal in Jacksonville:

- Hazardous materials (paint, chemicals, oil)
- Electronics (take to e-waste recycling)
- Appliances with refrigerants (special handling required)
- Tires (recycling facilities available)

### Timing Your Cleanout

Jacksonville weather plays a role in planning your cleanout. Avoid scheduling during peak hurricane season (August-October) when storms could delay your project. Spring and fall offer the most comfortable working conditions.

## When to Call the Professionals

While many homeowners successfully complete cleanouts themselves, some situations benefit from professional help:

- **Estate cleanouts** with emotional challenges
- **Hoarding situations** requiring specialized expertise
- **Time-sensitive sales** that need quick turnaround
- **Physical limitations** that prevent heavy lifting

904 Dumpster can recommend trusted cleanout services in Jacksonville if you need additional help beyond dumpster rental.

## Ready to Start Your Cleanout?

A dumpster on-site makes any cleanout project more efficient. No trips to the dump, no overloaded vehicles, and no waiting for trash day. Call 904 Dumpster at (904) 240-5598 to schedule your delivery and make your Jacksonville home cleanout a success.

## Understanding Kitchen Renovation Debris

Kitchen renovations are among the most popular home improvement projects in Jacksonville, and for good reason. An updated kitchen increases home value and improves daily life. However, the demolition and construction process generates significant debris that requires proper planning and disposal.

### Common Types of Kitchen Debris

A typical kitchen renovation produces several categories of waste:

**Cabinets and Woodwork**
- Upper and lower cabinets
- Cabinet hardware
- Wood trim and molding
- Pantry shelving

**Countertops**
- Laminate, granite, or quartz surfaces
- Sink and faucet fixtures
- Backsplash tiles

**Flooring**
- Vinyl, tile, or hardwood flooring
- Underlayment materials
- Transition strips

**Appliances**
- Refrigerators
- Dishwashers
- Stoves and ovens
- Microwaves

**Drywall and Structural Materials**
- Damaged drywall
- Insulation behind walls
- Electrical and plumbing components

## Choosing the Right Dumpster Size

For kitchen renovations, we typically recommend:

**10-Yard Dumpster** - Minor updates like cabinet refacing, new countertops only, or small kitchens with minimal demolition.

**15-Yard Dumpster** - Standard kitchen gut renovations. This size handles cabinets, countertops, flooring, and some drywall for most kitchens.

**20-Yard Dumpster** - Large kitchens, whole-floor renovations that include the kitchen, or projects involving structural changes.

## Special Disposal Considerations

### Appliances

Refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioning units contain refrigerants that require special handling under EPA regulations. In Jacksonville, you have options:

- **JEA bulk pickup**: Available for some appliances
- **Appliance recyclers**: Many will pick up for free or small fee
- **Scrap metal dealers**: Often pay for old appliances

We can accept appliances in our dumpsters if refrigerants have been properly removed and certified by a technician.

### Countertops

Different countertop materials have different disposal requirements:

- **Laminate**: Goes directly in the dumpster
- **Granite/Quartz**: Heavy but disposable in dumpster (watch weight limits)
- **Solid surface (Corian)**: Can be recycled by some facilities

### Cabinets

Cabinets in good condition can often be donated to organizations like Habitat for Humanity ReStore. This reduces your disposal costs and helps others.

## Timeline for Debris Management

**Day 1-2: Demolition**
Most kitchen debris is generated during the first two days. Plan to have your dumpster delivered before demolition begins.

**Days 3-10: Construction**
New construction generates less debris but adds up over time. Packaging from new materials, cut-offs, and minor waste accumulate.

**Final Day: Cleanup**
Reserve space for final cleanup debris, damaged materials discovered during installation, and packaging from finishing touches.

## Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Schedule efficiently**: Rent the dumpster for the minimum days needed to avoid extra fees
2. **Donate first**: Remove donatable items before demolition day
3. **Break down materials**: Flatten boxes and break down cabinets to maximize space
4. **Load strategically**: Place heavy items on the bottom and fill gaps with smaller debris

## Ready for Your Kitchen Renovation?

Having a dumpster on-site from day one makes your kitchen renovation smoother and keeps the project on schedule. Call 904 Dumpster at (904) 240-5598 for same-day delivery throughout Jacksonville and Northeast Florida.

## Understanding Dumpster Sizes

Dumpster sizes are measured in cubic yards, which represents the volume of debris the container can hold. While this measurement is standard across the industry, visualizing what it means for your project can be challenging.

### 10-Yard Dumpster

**Dimensions**: 12 feet long x 8 feet wide x 3.5 feet high

**Capacity**: 10 cubic yards (approximately 3 pickup truck loads)

**Weight Limit**: Up to 4,000 pounds (2 tons)

**Ideal Projects**:
- Small bathroom remodels
- Single room cleanouts
- Garage decluttering
- Small landscaping projects
- Minor roofing repairs (up to 1,500 sq ft)

The 10-yard dumpster is our most compact option, making it perfect for Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach homes with smaller driveways. Its lower height makes loading easier without needing to lift items over your head.

### 15-Yard Dumpster

**Dimensions**: 16 feet long x 8 feet wide x 4 feet high

**Capacity**: 15 cubic yards (approximately 5 pickup truck loads)

**Weight Limit**: Up to 6,000 pounds (3 tons)

**Ideal Projects**:
- Full roof replacements (up to 3,000 sq ft)
- Kitchen or bathroom gut renovations
- Medium home cleanouts (2-3 bedrooms)
- Deck removal
- Flooring replacement projects

The 15-yard dumpster is our most popular size in Jacksonville. It provides significantly more capacity than the 10-yard while still fitting in most residential driveways.

### 20-Yard Dumpster

**Dimensions**: 22 feet long x 8 feet wide x 4.5 feet high

**Capacity**: 20 cubic yards (approximately 7 pickup truck loads)

**Weight Limit**: Up to 8,000 pounds (4 tons)

**Ideal Projects**:
- Whole-house cleanouts
- Large construction projects
- Major home renovations
- Commercial cleanouts
- Estate cleanouts
- Storm debris cleanup

The 20-yard dumpster handles the biggest residential projects. Popular in Clay County and St. Johns County where larger properties are common.

## How to Estimate Your Debris Volume

### Method 1: The Room Count

For cleanout projects, use this rough guide:
- 1 room = 10-yard dumpster
- 2-3 rooms = 15-yard dumpster
- 4+ rooms or whole house = 20-yard dumpster

### Method 2: The Pickup Truck Comparison

If you have ever loaded a pickup truck with debris, use this conversion:
- 3 pickup loads = 10-yard dumpster
- 5 pickup loads = 15-yard dumpster
- 7 pickup loads = 20-yard dumpster

### Method 3: Square Footage for Roofing

For roofing projects, base your choice on roof size:
- Up to 1,500 sq ft = 10-yard dumpster
- 1,500-3,000 sq ft = 15-yard dumpster
- 3,000+ sq ft = 20-yard dumpster

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Going Too Small

The most common mistake is underestimating debris volume. Once a dumpster is full, you will need to pay for a swap or haul-away and get a second dumpster. This costs more than renting the larger size from the start.

**Tip**: When in doubt, go one size up. The price difference is usually less than the cost of a second dumpster.

### Ignoring Weight Limits

Cubic yard capacity and weight limits are different constraints. Heavy materials like concrete, dirt, roofing shingles, and drywall can hit weight limits before filling the container.

**Heavy Material Guidelines**:
- Concrete/brick: 10-yard maximum, load only 1/4 full
- Dirt/sand: 10-yard maximum, load only 1/3 full
- Roofing shingles: Account for 100-200 lbs per square

### Forgetting About Access

Make sure the dumpster you choose will fit in your delivery location:
- Measure your driveway length and width
- Check for overhead obstructions (tree branches, power lines)
- Ensure the delivery truck can access your property

## Why Some Items Are Prohibited

Landfills have strict regulations about what they can accept. Prohibited items fall into several categories:

- **Environmental hazards**: Items that could contaminate soil or groundwater
- **Safety risks**: Materials that could injure workers or cause fires
- **Regulatory requirements**: Items requiring special handling by law
- **Recycling mandates**: Materials that must be recycled rather than landfilled

Understanding these restrictions helps protect the environment, keeps workers safe, and ensures your dumpster rental goes smoothly.

## Hazardous Materials

The following hazardous materials are never allowed in dumpsters:

### Chemicals and Liquids
- Paint (latex or oil-based)
- Paint thinners and solvents
- Motor oil and automotive fluids
- Pesticides and herbicides
- Pool chemicals
- Cleaning chemicals in liquid form
- Gasoline and other fuels

### Batteries
- Car batteries
- Lithium batteries
- Rechargeable batteries
- Industrial batteries

### Other Hazardous Items
- Propane tanks
- Fire extinguishers
- Aerosol cans with contents
- Fluorescent light bulbs
- Mercury thermometers

**Where to Dispose in Jacksonville**:
Duval County Household Hazardous Waste facility accepts these items from residents. Check the COJ website for hours and locations.

## Electronics (E-Waste)

Florida law prohibits the disposal of certain electronics in landfills:

- Computers and monitors
- Televisions
- Printers and copiers
- Cell phones and tablets
- DVD and gaming equipment

**Jacksonville E-Waste Options**:
- Best Buy: Free recycling for small electronics

## Appliances with Refrigerants

Appliances containing refrigerants (Freon) require special handling under EPA regulations:

- Refrigerators
- Freezers
- Air conditioners (window and central)
- Dehumidifiers
- Water coolers

**How to Dispose**:
A certified technician must remove refrigerants before disposal. Many appliance recyclers and scrap metal dealers offer this service. Once properly evacuated and certified, these appliances can go in your dumpster.

## Medical Waste

Medical waste requires specialized disposal:

- Syringes and needles (sharps)
- Medications and prescriptions
- Medical equipment
- Biohazardous materials

**Jacksonville Options**:
- Pharmacies: Many accept unused medications
- Hospital collection: Some facilities accept sharps
- CVS and Walgreens: Drug disposal kiosks available

## Tires

Tires are banned from Florida landfills due to their tendency to rise to the surface and harbor pests.

**Where to Take Tires**:
- Tire retailers (often charge a fee)
- Duval County facilities
- Tire recycling companies

## What About These Common Items?

### Mattresses
**Allowed** in most cases. Some landfills restrict them, but our standard service accepts mattresses.

### Furniture
**Allowed**. Couches, chairs, tables, and other furniture can go in the dumpster.

### Carpet and Padding
**Allowed**. Roll carpet tightly to maximize space.

### Construction Materials
**Allowed** with some exceptions:
- Asbestos: Requires special handling and testing
- Treated lumber: Check with us first
- Concrete/brick: Allowed but counts heavily toward weight limits

### Yard Waste
**Allowed** in most cases. Grass, branches, and landscaping debris are accepted.

## What Happens If Prohibited Items Are Found?

When we deliver your dumpster contents to the landfill, the facility inspects the load. If prohibited items are discovered:

1. The load may be rejected
2. Additional fees may apply
3. Items must be separated for proper disposal
4. Additional hauling charges may be incurred

To avoid these issues, keep prohibited items separate and use appropriate disposal methods.

## Have Questions About Specific Items?

Not sure if something can go in your dumpster? Call us at (904) 240-5598 before loading it. We are happy to clarify what is allowed and suggest alternatives for prohibited items.

## Understanding Roofing Debris Weight

Roofing materials are deceptively heavy. A dumpster can reach its weight limit long before it appears full, making proper planning essential for roofing projects.

### Shingle Weight Calculations

Standard asphalt shingles weigh approximately 200-300 pounds per "square" (100 square feet of coverage). A typical Jacksonville home has:

- **1,500 sq ft roof**: 15 squares = 3,000-4,500 lbs of shingles
- **2,500 sq ft roof**: 25 squares = 5,000-7,500 lbs of shingles
- **3,500 sq ft roof**: 35 squares = 7,000-10,500 lbs of shingles

These weights assume a single layer. Homes with multiple layers of shingles can have double or triple the weight.

### Additional Debris

Beyond shingles, roofing projects generate:
- Underlayment (felt or synthetic)
- Flashing and drip edge
- Damaged decking/plywood
- Nails and fasteners
- Ridge vents and caps

## Choosing the Right Dumpster

For roofing projects, we recommend:

**15-Yard Dumpster**
- Best for: Roofs up to 25 squares (2,500 sq ft)
- Weight limit: 6,000 lbs (3 tons)
- Single-layer removal only

**20-Yard Dumpster**
- Best for: Roofs over 25 squares
- Weight limit: 8,000 lbs (4 tons)
- Can handle some multi-layer removal

**Multiple Dumpsters**
Large commercial roofs or multi-layer residential roofs may require multiple dumpsters or scheduled swap-outs.

## Dumpster Placement for Roofing

Strategic dumpster placement makes the job safer and faster:

### Ideal Placement
- Close to the work area but not blocking crew movement
- Away from overhead lines and tree branches
- On stable, level ground
- Accessible for pickup truck

### Protection Tips
- Place plywood under the dumpster to protect driveways
- Consider where debris will land during tear-off
- Keep the area around the dumpster clear of nails and debris

## Jacksonville Weather Considerations

Northeast Florida weather impacts roofing projects:

**Summer (June-September)**
- Schedule work for early morning hours
- Secure tarps for afternoon thunderstorms
- Have the dumpster ready for quick cleanup before storms

**Hurricane Season (June-November)**
- Monitor weather forecasts closely
- Consider project timing carefully
- Have plans for securing the dumpster if storms approach

**Winter (December-February)**
- Ideal working conditions
- Fewer weather delays
- Higher demand from contractors

## Tips for Contractors

### Efficient Loading
- Drop debris directly into the dumpster from the roof edge when possible
- Load heavy materials first
- Distribute weight evenly across the dumpster
- Fill gaps with lighter materials

### Scheduling
- Order the dumpster 1-2 days before project start
- Confirm pickup timing based on project completion
- Build in buffer for weather delays

### Safety
- Keep the dumpster clear of the work zone
- Mark any nails or sharp debris areas
- Ensure crew knows weight limits

## For Homeowners

If you are hiring a roofing contractor, understand how debris disposal is handled:

**Contractor-Provided Dumpster**
Many roofers include dumpster rental in their quote. Confirm what is included and whether there are weight overage fees.

**Homeowner-Provided Dumpster**
Some homeowners prefer to rent their own dumpster. This can save money but makes you responsible for the dumpster rental.

**Questions to Ask Your Roofer**:
1. Is debris removal included in the quote?
2. Are there potential overage charges?
3. How will my property be protected?
4. What happens to the old roofing materials?

## Scheduling Your Roofing Dumpster

- Same-day delivery for urgent projects

## Types of Demolition Debris

Demolition projects generate a diverse mix of materials, each with different disposal requirements:

### Heavy Materials
- **Concrete**: Foundation pieces, sidewalks, driveways
- **Brick and block**: Walls, chimneys, decorative features
- **Asphalt**: Driveway and parking lot surfaces
- **Stone**: Landscaping materials, countertops

### Standard Debris
- **Wood**: Framing, siding, trim, decking
- **Drywall**: Interior walls and ceilings
- **Roofing**: Shingles, underlayment, flashing
- **Flooring**: Carpet, vinyl, tile, hardwood

### Metals
- **Steel and iron**: Structural elements, rebar
- **Copper**: Plumbing, electrical wiring
- **Aluminum**: Siding, gutters, window frames

### Special Handling Required
- **Asbestos**: Pre-1980 buildings may contain asbestos
- **Lead paint**: Homes built before 1978
- **Treated lumber**: Pressure-treated wood products

## Dumpster Recommendations by Project

### Interior Demolition
For gutting rooms or removing non-structural elements:
- **15-yard dumpster**: Sufficient for most single-room projects
- **20-yard dumpster**: Multiple rooms or extensive drywall removal

### Exterior Demolition
For decks, sheds, or outbuildings:
- **15-yard dumpster**: Small shed or single deck
- **20-yard dumpster**: Large decks, multiple structures

### Full Structure Demolition
For complete building demolition:
- **Multiple 20-yard dumpsters**: Scheduled swap-outs
- **Heavy debris dumpster**: Separate container for concrete/masonry
- Consider 904 Dumpster's full demolition services

## Working with Heavy Materials

Concrete, brick, and other masonry require special consideration:

### Weight Limits
Heavy materials can easily exceed dumpster weight limits:
- Concrete weighs approximately 150 lbs per cubic foot
- A small 10-yard dumpster loaded 1/4 full with concrete = 3,500+ lbs

### Best Practices
1. Request a "heavy debris" dumpster designed for masonry
2. Keep heavy materials in a separate container from general debris
3. Load heavy items on the bottom, distributed evenly
4. Never exceed the fill line, regardless of weight

### Cost Considerations
Heavy material disposal often costs more per ton than general debris. Separating materials can reduce overall costs.

## Jacksonville Demolition Permits

Before starting any demolition project in Jacksonville/Duval County:

### When Permits Are Required
- Demolition of any structure over 120 square feet
- Removal of load-bearing walls
- Any work affecting utilities
- Projects in historic districts

### How to Obtain Permits
1. Contact the City of Jacksonville Building Inspection Division
2. Submit demolition plans and permit application
3. Schedule required inspections
4. Display permit on site during work

### Utility Disconnection
Before demolition:
- Contact JEA for electric and water disconnection
- Notify gas company if applicable
- Confirm all utilities are properly capped

## Environmental Considerations

### Asbestos Testing
Buildings constructed before 1980 may contain asbestos in:
- Floor tiles and adhesives
- Insulation
- Roofing materials
- Siding and shingles
- Ceiling tiles

**Requirement**: Florida law requires asbestos testing before demolition of structures built before 1980.

### Lead Paint
Homes built before 1978 may contain lead paint:
- Hire certified contractors for lead abatement
- Follow EPA RRP (Renovation, Repair, and Painting) rules
- Proper disposal of lead-contaminated materials

### Storm Water Protection
Demolition sites must prevent sediment runoff:
- Install silt fencing around the perimeter
- Cover soil piles during rain
- Sweep streets to prevent debris entering storm drains

## Preparing Before the Storm

Smart Jacksonville homeowners think about debris management before hurricanes arrive:

### Pre-Storm Checklist
- Secure loose outdoor items
- Trim dead tree branches
- Document your property with photos/video
- Know your insurance policy details
- Have contractor contacts ready

### Pre-Position a Dumpster?
For properties with known tree hazards or aging structures, some homeowners arrange for a dumpster to be delivered immediately after the storm passes. Call 904 Dumpster before storm season to discuss pre-positioning arrangements.

## Immediately After the Storm

### Safety First
Before beginning any cleanup:
- Wait for official all-clear from authorities
- Watch for downed power lines (assume all wires are live)
- Wear protective gear (gloves, boots, eye protection)
- Check for structural damage before entering buildings
- Document all damage for insurance claims

### Assess the Damage
Common hurricane debris categories:
- **Vegetative debris**: Trees, branches, leaves, plants
- **Construction debris**: Roofing, siding, fencing, drywall
- **Household goods**: Furniture, appliances, personal items
- **Hazardous materials**: Fuel, chemicals, propane tanks

## City of Jacksonville Debris Programs

After significant storms, Jacksonville typically activates special debris removal programs:

### Curbside Debris Collection
- City contracts with debris removal companies
- Specific pickup schedules announced by zone
- Debris must be separated by type
- Check COJ.net for current program status

### Debris Separation Requirements
To participate in city programs, separate debris into:
1. **Vegetative**: Keep separate from other materials
2. **Construction**: Roofing, building materials, fencing
3. **Household**: Furniture, carpeting, household items
4. **Appliances**: White goods collected separately
5. **Hazardous**: Special collection required

### Timeline Expectations
City debris removal can take weeks or months depending on storm severity. Plan for extended cleanup periods.

## When to Rent a Dumpster

Private dumpster rental makes sense when:

### Faster Cleanup Needed
If you cannot wait for city programs:
- Insurance company requires quick cleanup
- Property must be secured
- Health hazards need immediate removal
- Reconstruction needs to begin

### Large Volume of Debris
City curbside pickup has volume limits:
- Very large trees require commercial equipment
- Extensive building damage exceeds curbside capacity
- Multiple properties need simultaneous cleanup

### Convenience and Control
A dumpster on your property allows:
- Work at your own pace
- Secure storage of debris
- No waiting for city trucks
- Privacy for personal items disposal

## Insurance and Debris Removal

### Document Everything
Before moving any debris:
- Take photos from multiple angles
- Video walk-throughs of damage
- Keep a written inventory
- Save receipts for all cleanup expenses

### Debris Removal Coverage
Most homeowner policies include debris removal:
- Typically a separate coverage amount
- May have per-occurrence limits
- Keep all receipts for reimbursement
- Ask about additional living expenses if applicable

### Working with Your Adjuster
- Request adjuster visit before major cleanup if possible
- Get approval before hiring contractors
- Understand coverage limits for debris removal
- Ask about dumpster rental reimbursement

## Specific Debris Types

### Tree Debris
- Large trees may require professional removal
- Cut branches to manageable lengths for city pickup
- Root balls may require excavation equipment
- Stumps can often be ground in place

### Flood-Damaged Items
Items exposed to flood water are typically unsalvageable:
- Upholstered furniture
- Mattresses and bedding
- Carpet and padding
- Drywall below water line
- Particleboard furniture

### Contaminated Materials
Some items require special handling:
- Fuel containers
